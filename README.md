# Verse Rush

## How it Works

Verse Rush is a Bible verse game made with Unity. A verse is first displayed for a few seconds on the screen and blanks are then added. Players must type in the missing words and try their best to memorize the given verse. After the given blanks are filled, more blanks will be added until the entire verse is blank.
